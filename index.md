title: "TAAP25: Theory and Applications of Algorithms with Predictions"
---

# Workshop Scope

Machine Learning has revolutionized the world, and has already made a profound impact on our perception of algorithms. More specifically, in recent years, the new 
area of _Algorithms with Predictions_ has emerged at the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science  and ML, which studies the interplay between ML and the design/analysis of algorithms with strict, provable performance guarantees. Its aim is to address fundamental questions related to modeling, performance evaluation and theoretical analysis, from the point of view of both possibility and impossibility 
results on the theoretical performance. Examples of such directions include:

* How can one leverage (possibly imperfect) predictions, generated by machine learning approaches, in a robust manner,
to obtain near-optimal performance when the predictions are accurate, while maintaining worst-case guarantees of classic algorithms?
* How can we model prediction error in ways that lead to a viable and valuable
theoretical analysis?
* When predictions are associated with costs, how does an algorithm decide on the ideal times to query a prediction?
* Which tools from ML can be applied in the analysis of algorithms with predictions?
